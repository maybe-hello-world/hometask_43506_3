You might want to use main.py to check task_1_quicksort and task_2_parsing modules.
Probably, it should be clear enough what all the code does.

log_source folder contains sources for the second task.
parsing_result folder should get result of the second task inside it after running the main module.

helpers folder just contains a class created to help generate some sources for the first task.
